Write a python program to calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere, based on user input of the radius


extension challenge - see if you can modify your program to also calculate the surface area and volume of a cube with that side-length, and a regular pyramid with that side length. So the user inputs a length, and the program calculates the properties of a sphere, pyramid AND a cube based on that length.
